Welcome to the ShadowLinks GitHub page.

ShadowLinks is a Bukkit Minecraft plugin which allows your users to use short simple commands in order to find useful links to your servers essential pages. There is also the ability to allow players to save personal notes. This is my first plugin therefore it is very simple.

More information and answers to your questions can be found on the Bukkit Dev Page: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/shadowlinks/

Thank you,
Luke
